  <div class="entry-content"><p>Click <a href="http://systemtemplar.org/blog/2012/12/16/my-first-lisa-conference/">here</a> to see my first writeup</p>

<p>Once again I convinced $dayjob to spring for (most of) my trip to <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13">LISA13</a>
I did a big write up for management last year, and did several training sessions
with other employees as it was very much worth the cost / time / effort in my
opinion.</p>

<p>This year was quite a bit further for me to travel, as I am on the west coast,
and LISA is on the east coast. Google maps says that it&#8217;s 4421 km (2747 miles).
I don&#8217;t think I can complain about the travel time as there are people I met
who came from the UK, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, etc.</p>

<p>Once again I did one day of training and 3 days of the technical sessions, and again I
did get all of the training material (which is totally worth the day of
training, regardless of what training you take).</p>

<h3>My Training</h3>

<p>The first course I took was Theodore Ts&#8217;o&#8217;s &#8220;Recovering from Linux Hard Drive
Disasters&#8221; which, was a very informative course on the history of file systems
but I would have preferred some demos of fixing some broken file systems. Enter debugfs
and fix some deleted files, or show WHEN it is better to hit no in a fsck, etc.
I think that Ted Ts&#8217;o is well informed and a great speaker, it was just the
history material was a little long, and not really on topic.</p>

<p>The second course I took was Joshua Jensen&#8217;s &#8220;High-Availability Linux
Clustering&#8221; which was a pretty good course. My only comments is, I would have
liked to see a demo, even if it was a short one.</p>

<h3>My session highlights</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/sysadmins-unleashed-building-autonomous-systems-teams-walt-disney-animation">Disney animation studio presentation</a> was fantastic, I was very impressed
with what they have done with traditional management roles and how they are
evolving to something that I think will work a lot better for pretty much all
medium to large IT organizations and I do hope that more people will follow
their example. Disney Animation studios is now on my list of &#8220;cool companies
I would like to work for someday&#8221;.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/data-engineering-complex-systems">&#8220;surprise plenary&#8221;</a> session on flamegraphs was also very good. It was a
surprise because the scheduled speaker got sick and had to go to hospital (she
is okay) so they needed a plenary session and had 1 hour notice. Branden had
one hours notice to take a 30 minute talk and turn it into a hour and half talk
and he was up till 4 in the morning coding on a new type of graph (Chain
graphs) I think he did a really good job.</p>

<p><a href="http://dankaminsky.com/">Dan Kaminsky&#8217;s</a> talk <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/rethinking-dogma">&#8220;Rethinking Dogma: Musings on the
Future of Security&#8221;</a> was very good (and thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/standaloneSA">Matt Simmons</a> for the
recommendation, I wasn&#8217;t sure which talk to go to for that time block).</p>

<h3>The closing plenary</h3>

<p>The closing plenary session was called <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/postops-non-surgical-tale-software-fragility-and-reliability">&#8220;Post Ops: A Non-surgical (personal)
tale of fragility and reliability&#8221;</a> by Todd Underwood (Google). It was a fairly
amusing talk with a lot of interesting points. Todd is offering that sysadmins
are going to go the way of the dodo bird, or more specifically that the ops
part of devops is going to go away and that everybody should become developers.</p>

<p>There is a part of me that agrees a little but I think there is a rather large
disconnect with the industry that is, and what google is doing. I think Todd
may have his google glass blinders on and is only seeing things from the google
perspective. While I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s nice place to live I don&#8217;t think it is grounded
in reality.</p>

<p>There are people who are using 10 year old software and hardware now, a lot of
people. The same is going to be true in 10 years from now. In 10 years there
will still be people using windows 7 and 8, and just starting to get
a plan together to adopt windows 2023 / windows 18 or whatever it is called.
Administration of those devices is going to be the same then as it is now.</p>

<p>I can understand his point, if you think about a small office with 20 employees
who are, say real estate agents who have 20 chromebooks or 21 with a spare,
everything is wireless and they microsoft office 360 / google docs. I don&#8217;t see
the need for an IT person. In the last 10 years or perhaps even today there
would be a tipping point. Maybe when the office reaches 50 people or 100, an
IT person would eventually be hired. Will the tipping point drastically move
or be eliminated entirely? People are still going to be terrible with computers
and need help. I think helpdesk people are safe at least. :)</p>

<h3>Other highlights</h3>

<p>The so called &#8220;Hallway track&#8221; was really great this year. I got to have breakfast
with <a href="http://everythingsysadmin.com/">Tom Limoncelli</a> and <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/">Tobias Oetiker</a> and out for dinner with <a href="http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/">Matt Simmons</a>
and many others. We had some cool conversations about system administration as
a whole and where we think it is going.</p>

<h3>Birds of a feather</h3>

<p>The birds of a feather this year were very good, although I did find that there
were more vendor bofs than there were last year. Not sure if that is good or
bad.</p>

<h3>Books</h3>

<p>Books that were recomended at the conference (That are not on safari bookshelf):</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve ordered:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drift-into-Failure-Sidney-Dekker/dp/1409422216">Drift into Failure</a></p>

<h3>Title Transition</h3>

<p>It seems as though we are transitioning from the title &#8220;System Administrator&#8221;
to &#8220;Site Reliability Engineer&#8221;. I think this is kind of an odd choice. The SRE
name has been around for a long time, it&#8217;s just now instead of google using it
many other companies are switching as well.</p>

<p>The old:</p>

<p>&#8220;System&#8221; is a broad term, and it fits. Most system administrators I know are in
charge of anything that has blinking lights on it, and often many other things
that don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;Administrator&#8221; is a person who manages (takes charge of). Again I think this
makes sense for what we do.</p>

<p>The new:</p>

<p>A site reliability engineer is a odd title to me. &#8220;Site&#8221; in the modern sense
of the word infers a web-site, which can be very complicated, or very simple.
In the old sense of the word like a job site, implies you are concerned with
the reliability of an entire physical location (job-site).</p>

<p>&#8220;Reliability&#8221; makes sense, we you want to make sure the website/job-site is
reliable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Engineer&#8221; is somewhat of an issue for me personally, but I think this is more to
do with a Canadian upbringing. Where I am from, one doesn&#8217;t up and call
themselves an engineer without having a degree in engineering. This comes from
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ritual_of_the_Calling_of_an_Engineer">Ritual of the Calling</a>
where after (some|most) Canadian engineers wear the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Ring">iron ring</a>.
I am not an engineer, and around here people would consider it disingenuous if
I called myself a site reliability engineer without having a proper engineering degree.</p>

<p>As well, I&#8217;m not just concerned with the reliability of the site, I&#8217;m also
worried about capacity planning, future proofing, scaling, security, updates,
etc.</p>

<p>I wonder how long it will be before someone wants to call me an SRE instead of
sysadmin?</p>

<h3>Small Infrastructure Bof</h3>

<p>I attended the small infrastructure Bof, even though my infrastructure is not
really that small. I did the same last year; I find them interesting. One
of the topics that came up was:</p>

<p>Is LISA still relevant for the small / medium system administrators?</p>

<p>I think system administration is splitting into groups of complexity. According
to me it looks something like this:</p>

<p>&lt; 100 boxes/vms/nodes/devices/whatever you want to call it
small shops</p>

<p>&lt; 1,000
medium shops</p>

<p>&lt; 5,000
large shops</p>

<p>&lt; 50,000
very large shops</p>

<p>> 50,000
massive shops</p>

<p>LISA has a tendency to prefer talks from massive shops or contractors that work
with massive shops. This makes sense because the massive shops have a tendency
to be the ones who are pushing the industry forward. Also, the L in LISA refers
to large. However when LISA started in 1986 a large system was what we now
consider to be small.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t currently think that we need to split LISA up, but I do think the LISA
organizers need to be somewhat
mindful to the small shops and what they are gaining from the conference. The
company I work for fits somewhere between medium and large shops, and I was in
the lisa session: Enterprise Architecture Beyond the Perimeter, and it WAS
interesting information but this was more a massive shop problem. I didn&#8217;t find
the talk relevant to anything I was doing or would be doing in the small /
medium term. I could have got up and left the talk, but like I said, it was
interesting information.</p>

<h3>Random notes</h3>

<p>Just some random notes I took:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Linuxfest Northwest 2013</h3>

<p>I went to <a href="http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/">Linuxfest Northwest</a> again this
year, and I had a great time.</p>

<p>This year I organized the <a href="http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/content/lightning-talks">Lightning Talks</a>
 and plan on doing the lightning talks each year at linuxfest. We had a great
variety of lightning talks, it was pretty fun.</p>

<p>I also did a session called &#8220;I wanna be the guy - The arduous path to senior
sysadmin or How to be a better system administrator&#8221; which you can see here:</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bSAgQqa49nM "></iframe></div>


<p>It is my first talk at a conference but I hope to do more in the future.</p>

<p>It took a while to get online, as I first did the video with
<a href="http://www.openshotvideo.com/">openshot</a> but what was on the video preview was
not what the end video looked like. So I tried to work around it with openshot
but eventually gave up. Did the same thing uses a friend&#8217;s copy of
<a href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegassoftware">Vegas</a> and it was a much
nicer experience. Openshot is <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/421164014/openshot-video-editor-for-windows-mac-and-linux">working on a new
UI</a>
 and I look forward to using it the next time I need to cut some video together.</p>

<h3>The fest</h3>

<p>Linuxfest Northwest 2013 was very fun, I like the sessions and meeting fellow
linux enthusiasts. I&#8217;m more interested in finding other system administrators
so I am always on the hunt to find them. Maybe I need to do an early birds of a
feather for sysadmins so I can find out who the sysadmins are nice and early
and then try to find them through-out the day.</p>

<p>The ID badge for lfnw deserves special mention. I have been to several
conferences but this was the first that I have been to that had this type of
badge. The badge was essentially a small booklet, on the front and back was
your name and information; but inside the booklet was the conference schedule,
and maps to the various rooms and events going on. This was very cool.</p>

<p>The after party on Saturday was at a museum called <a href="http://www.whatcommuseum.org/about/buildings">The
lightcatcher</a>. There were several nice exhibits, I liked the
glass sculptures; but I didn&#8217;t think to take any pictures
(which may have not been allowed, I don&#8217;t remember). I didn&#8217;t stay very late at
the after party because I needed to finish up my slides (for the talk i was
giving the next day).</p>

<p>I look forward to linuxfest 2014.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Upgreyedd</h3>

<p>First and foremost, I am not a fan of <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedUp">FedUp</a></p>

<p>My luck hasn&#8217;t been good with it, but I do some stuff that is off the beaten
path, so it is likely my fault. I am fortunate enough to have extra hard drives
kicking around so install a OS on a spare hard drive to test out it&#8217;s
installation is no problem for me. However in this case I have a shiny new PC
to setup.</p>

<p>The new PC is ASUS P9X79LE, w/32 gigs of ram, and a 3.6 ghz proc.</p>

<h3>Why use Fedora?</h3>

<p>I use fedora because I work at a CentOS shop, and using fedora keeps me fresh
on what changes are coming to the RHEL ecosystem. There are quite a few big
changes coming in the RHEL pipeline so it&#8217;s just a good way of seeing what is
on it&#8217;s way and gives me a chance to explore how the new stuff works.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Anaconda (The fedora gui installer) has been completely re-written, and was
(at least partly) responsible for the delays in getting fedora 18 released.</p>

<p>The new gui looks nice, but I have some complaints. Currently when you select
the encryption option it encrypts the entire physical volume, rather then
encrypted the logical volume. This means, that it&#8217;s encrypting the whole hard
drive instead of just a particular partition.</p>

<p>Typically in my linux installations I setup a /home partition and encrypt it
using luks. The previous version of anaconda this was easy to do. I have
commented on a <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=880876">bug report</a>
about this.</p>

<p>I setup my /home partition unencrypted at installation time, so I will fix this
later in this writeup.</p>

<h3>Dual Booting with UEFI</h3>

<p>I have used UEFI bios many times in a server environment, but this is my first PC with a UEFI
bios at home. One of the fun parts is, you don&#8217;t need to worry about windows
over writing grub anymore (or grub forgetting to add the windows partition(s)).
With a UEFI bios you pick which drive you are going to boot with using the bios
menu. NOTE: I still have a windows partition for the occasional video game that
I can&#8217;t get working with wine.</p>

<p>My motherboard is a Asus P9X79 LE, and the original bios version did not work
with the F8 boot menu. If I selected the UEFI boot order in the bios itself it
would work, but if I hit F8, it would not boot off any other drive. I did a
BIOS update and that solved the problem.</p>

<h3>Speaking of Bios Updates</h3>

<p>I usually do BIOS updates using the windows boot disks, because generally
speaking vendors test the windows portions more than the linux ones. So I saved
the bios upgrade to c:\bios on my windows partition, loaded the asus EZ flash,
navigated to the bios file, and it failed saying that the bios wasn&#8217;t a EFI
bios.</p>

<p>After some googling I found that the EZ flash is able the navigate ntfs folders
but can&#8217;t load bios files from ntfs (which is really odd). So I copied the bios
file to /boot/efi on my linux partition (which is a VFAT partition iirc) and
fired up the EZ flash again and it was able to find and use the bios upgrade
just fine.</p>

<p>After the bios upgrade I am able to use the F8 bios boot menu just fine.</p>

<h3>Post Installation</h3>

<p>I like to record my steps on what I do after installing so I can come back if I
ever need to.</p>

<p>First the bare essentials:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>yum install vim gvim tmux terminator xchat pidgin git thunderbird wget curl</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<pre><code>I will do a whole blog post on my vim setup on a much later date.
tmux is a screen replacement that is awesome.
terminator is a graphical terminal that is also awesome.
xchat for gui irc
pidgin for instant messaging
thunderbird for email
git for source control
and wget and curl for pure utility
</code></pre>

<p>Next Disable evil bash search prompt:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>echo 'unset command_not_found_handle' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is the thing that searches for typos when you typo. it slows things down
far to much for fast typers. I have a fancy .bashrc that I&#8217;ll talk
about some other time.</p>

<p>NOTE: Before the zsh people get on my case about not switching to zsh, it&#8217;s not
something I&#8217;m ready to deploy on all my work servers, so I&#8217;m sticking with bash
until I can deploy zsh everywhere I work.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>yum update</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Boot settings</h3>

<p><strong>fstab</strong></p>

<p>NOTE: Don&#8217;t mess around with your fstab unless you know what you are doing.</p>

<p>I have a ssd disk, so I need to add the &#8216;discard&#8217; option to the fstab for
the partitions that are ssd backed.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>old:
</span><span class='line'>/dev/mapper/vg_shinix-lv_root /     ext4      defaults        1 1

<p>but do that for each partition that is ssd, though not on the luks partition as
that would be foolish (iirc luks partitions ignore the discard option).</p>

<p><strong>grub</strong></p>

<p>NOTE: Don&#8217;t play with your grub settings unless you know what you are doing.</p>

<p>Being that I have a ssd drive, I will want elevator=noop for my scheduler, and
I am not a fan of the graphical boot so I will disable that via removing the
rhgb and quiet options.</p>

<p>I will also be using the nvidia driver, so I will disable the nouveau kernel
module via rdblacklist=nouveau</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t used grub2 yet it might be a little jarring of an experience.
Rather than the simple vi /boot/grub/grub.conf, you now get to:</p>

<p>reboot
(actually reboot cuz you have installed a new kernel and nvidia instructions
require you to be on the new kernel)</p>

<p><strong>Nvidia Drivers</strong></p>

<p>I have a fancy video card (Geforce GTX 660ti) and I plan on trying out steam
for linux, so I need to get the nvidia drivers going.</p>

<p>The instructions I found on <a href="http://www.forums.fedoraforum.org/">fedoraforum</a> will work, but require a bit of
tinkering.</p>

<p>NOTE: I am following the instructions <a href="http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=280750">here</a></p>

<p>but due to a <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=873220">bug</a> added &#8220;-o nouveau&#8221; to the dracut option.</p>

<p>so:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>dracut -o nouveau /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img /boot/$(uname -r)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Upon rebooting my system would crash. This was
annoying. So I did a rescue, and changed to boot to runlevel 3 (no gui).</p>

<p>After a reboot, I checked a &#8220;lsmod |egrep &#8216;nouv|nv&#8217;&#8221; to see what drivers I was
loading. There was no nvidia, and no nouveau. So the blacklist/dracut was working but
I wasn&#8217;t loading the nvidia kernel module either. A manual modprobe resulted
in:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had some experience with signed modules before, but it was a long time
ago. Hrm</p>

<p>no signature. This must be something else.</p>

<p>I tried booting with the kernel option:</p>

<p>enforcemodulesig=0 and module.sig_enforce=no, neither worked.</p>

<p>After a lot of googling, I found that the issue was with <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Secureboot">secure boot</a>
as soon as I turned it off (in the bios settings), I was able to load the nvidia module fine. There is
surprisingly little documentation on the internets about this error.</p>

<p>I posted <a href="http://www.forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?p=1633893#post1633893">this</a>
in hopes to save someone else some time (It took longer than I would have liked to
figure it out).</p>

<h3>Desktop</h3>

<p>I have been using cinnamon or frippery (cinnamon on the laptop, frippery on the
desktop) since fedora 15 came out (because gnome2 was ditched). Fedora 18 has
MATE which is the gnome2 fork. I&#8217;m really looking forward to using my old
desktop again.</p>

<p>MATE:</p>

<p>Ahh MATE, I used Gnome2 as my desktop for many years, so this was a big sigh of
relief. Even though I am going crazy daily due to
<a href="https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-control-center/issues/25">a keyboard shortcut bug</a>
I am loving using mate. As far as moving windows from
monitor to monitor (I have a 3 monitor setup) mate works a lot smoother than
everything else I have used so far. Mate has been available in other versions
of fedora, I just totally missed the boat on it.</p>

<p>The other issue I have with fedora&#8217;s installation of mate, is that it doesn&#8217;t
install the mate-screensaver rpm. I
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=911015">opened a bug report on this</a>
so hopefully it will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>To get MATE installed after installation do a :</p>

<h3>Disabling services</h3>

<p>Gone are the days of chkconfig &#8211;list, we need to use systemctl. Skipping over
a debate about systemctl, let&#8217;s move right into how to get going with it.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>systemctl list-unit-files --type=service</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You will see a nice color coded list of your services that are set to
enabled, disabled, or static. If a service is &#8216;static&#8217; that means it&#8217;s a
dependency of another service. For now, ignore static services and concentrate
on enabled services.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s figure out what all this stuff is.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#if you type
</span><span class='line'>systemctl
</span><span class='line'>#you will get short description of what everything is, you can work with just
</span><span class='line'>#that no problem.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#I like to see what rpm the services come from, here's how I do that:
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>systemctl list-unit-files --type=service |grep enabled |awk '{print $1}' |xargs locate |grep "/usr/lib" >> /tmp/list1
</span><span class='line'>for i in $(cat /tmp/list1); do printf "\nservice $i\n" >> /tmp/list2; rpm -qif $i >> /tmp/list2; done
</span><span class='line'>less /tmp/list2
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>NOTE: Yea I could do this all in 1 long command, but this is easier to
</span><span class='line'>understand for the sake of anyone who might read this. :)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The above should give you a nice txt file that will show the systemctl file,
and the rpm information about that rpm, for each enabled service.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of disabling what I don&#8217;t need.</p>

<p>NOTE: You may need some of these services, I don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>So looks like I&#8217;m disabling:</p>

<pre><code>atd : the AT Daemon, I never use it. I don't know anyone that does anymore.
bluetooth : not using any bluetooth devices
cups : never will print from here
libvirtd : have a different box for virtual machine playtime.
rpcbind : not using nfs
spice-vdagentd : not using spice / libvirtd
avahi : don't want this service
ksm : not using qemu/libvirt
ksm-tuned : not using qemu/libvirt
rngd : don't have a hardware rng device
sendmail : eww. removing sendmail installing postfix.
sm-client : part of sendmail
systemd-readahead-collect.service : readahead is not needed for ssd drives imo
systemd-readahead-drop.service : disabling readahead
systemd-readahead-replay.service : disabling readahead
</code></pre>

<p>Next take a look at the sockets:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl | grep socket

avahi-daemon.socket
cups.socket
pcscd.socket
rpcbind.socket
</code></pre>

<p>Going to make a quick file to speed up stopping and disabling everything:</p>

<p>I will be putting all my dot files on github, I just haven&#8217;t got around to it
yet. Need to clean a few things up first. :)</p>

<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>

<p>I am a big fan of dejavu-sans-mono for terminals / programming, which fedora
has default installed now. Just need to change the system monospaced font to
it. <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Droid+Sans+Mono">Droid sans mono</a>
is really nice as well.</p>

<h3>Closing</h3>

<p>Having been using Fedora 18 for about a week now, I&#8217;m pretty happy with it. I
will be upgrading my laptop and work desktop in the next week or two, so I can
get MATE on everything.</p>

<p>There is a lot of complaints about fedora 18, people are bitching about the
gnome3 changes, I am not sure what they are talking about; I used gnome 3 long
enough to install mate. :)</p>

<p>Gnome 3 is now the internet explorer of desktop environments.</p>

<p>The new anaconda is immature, there is no question. But it&#8217;s all python based,
so I think it will evolve quickly to support what the old anaconda could do.</p>

<p>As far as Fedora being <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTI4MjI">the worst redhat
distro</a> I have to
disagree. RedHat linux 6 in 1998 or so (not to be confused with redhat
enterprise linux) had a broken dhcp implementation, a grub bug where if you
pushed a key to boot (the booting linux in 3 seconds bit), it would only use
your first 4 partitions on your disk and ignore any other ones, and so many
other horrible bugs. Redhat linux 5 was so much better. Seemed like a giant
step backwards at the time (or was it from 6 to 7? hrm. maybe. it was 12-13 years
ago it&#8217;s a bit fuzzy and so not worth googling).</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I convinced my $dayjob to spring for a trip to
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa12">LISA12</a> in San Diego. Some places it
is easier than others to convince management it&#8217;s a good idea, it wasn&#8217;t too
bad for me.</p>

<p>For those who have never been to a LISA before, here is how it works:</p>

<h3>Training Program</h3>

<p>The event starts Sunday morning with training programs. Some are half day
programs, and some are full day. You have to sign up in advance for what
training program you want to attend*, and the training programs run until
Friday. One day worth of training session(s) costs $710.00 USD (this is the
usenix member price, but since joining usenix costs 50 dollars and the discount
is worth $170.00 USD, pretty much everyone joins usenix). There are various
deals for signing up for more training as well. The available training programs
are layed out
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa12/training-program/training-program">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Technical Sessions</h3>

<p>The
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa12/tech-schedule/technical-sessions">technical sessions</a>
start on Wednesday, and run through until Friday. The technical sessions are
shorter (1.5 hours or so) but are generally more advanced topics than what is
in the training programs. One day of technical sessions cost $405.00 USD (same
170 dollar discount applied already) or you can get 3 days of technical
sessions for $965.00.</p>

<h3>Golden Passport*</h3>

<p>The golden passport allows you to go to any technical training, or technical
session. As well, in the technical session conference rooms there are areas
that are reserved seating (right at the front) for people with a golden
passport. This is pretty cool, because if you decide that you don&#8217;t like the
training that you are attending, you can leave and go to another one. The
golden passport also comes with a cooler ID badge than everyone else, which
declares to everyone that you are a golden passport holder. It costs $4,075.00
USD, and while expensive would be a great way to enjoy the conference.</p>

<h3>Birds of a Feather</h3>

<p>The training programs / technical sessions end at 5:00 PM, and there is a 2
hour break for dinner; after which the birds of a feather (aka bof (pronounced
BOFF)) start. There are 2 kinds of bofs, a vendor bof or a individually
organized bof.</p>

<p>A vendor bof usually has booze at the back, to entice you to attend; while the
vendor either tries to sell you on their product, or sell you on working for
them (they try to recruit you).</p>

<p>The user bofs are generally more
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa12/birds-feather-sessions">random topics</a>
and a lot were organized at the last minute and written on the sign at the conference:</p>

<p><img src="/images/bofboard.jpg" title="Bof Board" ></p>

<h3>Vendor Booths</h3>

<p>Lastly there was the Vendor area, which is what it sounds like. There were many
(59) vendors that had lots of swag to hand out. This is the first conference
that I have been to, that in order to get the better swag (tshirts,
flashlights, etc) you needed to allow the vendor to scan your id badge (which
had a 2D bar code on the back with all of your contact info. Hopefully I don&#8217;t
start getting spammed like crazy, but I won&#8217;t hold my breath.</p>

<p>Some of my vendor highlights:</p>

<p><strong>Google&#8217;s Quest for the pins:</strong></p>

<p>Google gave out 1 pin to everybody, and via their questforthepins.com site you
had to do some simple sysadmin questions to progress to the next pin. There
were 5 pins in total, and the questions got harder as you go, but most people
attending got all 5 pins (myself included).</p>

<p><strong>Rackspace&#8217;s breakfix challenge:</strong>
Rackspace had 2 laptops setup with virtual machines running CentOS 6.3
that were broken, and you had to fix the virtual machine. They timed
how fast you could solve the problem. Us geeks love fixing things so
this was enjoyed by many. I did the challenge in ~9 minutes or so, I
could have gone faster but was typo&#8217;ing a lot on the tiny laptop
keyboards (and the sun was in my eyes :) ).</p>

<h3>My Experience</h3>

<p>This year&#8217;s LISA was held at the
<a href="http://www.sheratonsandiegohotel.com/">San Diego Sheraton</a> which was a pretty
nice hotel. Here is the view from the balcony of my room:</p>

<p><img src="/images/roomview.jpg" title="My room view panaramic" ></p>

<p>While attending LISA (or any conference really) I think it is a must to stay at
the conference hotel. I arrived Monday evening (So I could be ready for
Tuesdays training programs), pretty much right after checking in I went to the
bar and asked some guys wearing geek tshirts if I could join them, and was made
welcome. Almost all of the tables in the bar and lobby were occupied by people
using their phones/tablets/laptops and talking shop.</p>

<p>Many of the conversations I had in the lobbies and hallways were worth the
price of admission by itself. If you were thinking about deploying $product
you could easily find some people who had already done so, and were moving on
to something better, or maybe tell you horror stories of just how bad (or
fantastic) $product was. Or tell you what $product_competitor was like. The
best part being, that these were <em>colleagues</em> <strong>not</strong> salesmen, and their input
was insanely valuable.</p>

<p>I especially enjoyed the level of expertise at the conference. There was an
extremely good chance someone more expert than you was nearby and happy to talk
shop.</p>

<h3>What I did</h3>

<p>I wanted to checkout what the training was like, but was more interested in the
technical sessions. So, I did 1 day of training, and 3 days of technical
sessions.</p>

<p>The nice thing about doing 1 day worth of technical sessions, you get a USB key
loaded with the training materials for all of the technical sessions. So
according to me you would be remiss if you did not do at least one day of
technical training. Having the training materials is not as nice as being in
the classroom, and being able to ask questions and whatnot but it is pretty
cool to be able to check out. So far I&#8217;ve only gone over a few of them; but
this is due to the full schedule each day provides (if you choose to go to
everything).</p>

<p>The training/sessions run from 9:00 AM until 5:00 PM (with breaks for food),
then the bofs start at 7:00 PM and run until 11:00 PM. After the bofs I would
hang around in the lobby or bar until 1:00 AM talking with various groups of
sysadmins.</p>

<p>One of the things that surprised me, was just how far some people traveled to
be at LISA. I met people from Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Australia,
Brazil, etc. Next year&#8217;s conference is in Washington DC, which is quite a bit
further for me to travel. However, when I think about all the international
travellers I met, I don&#8217;t think I should complain.</p>

<p>Another cool thing, was after the first day, I started to see a few familiar
faces at a few of the technical sessions that I was going to, so we started to
hang out in between sessions. We then made plans to go out for lunches and
dinners to talk shop. Since then we have all exchanged info, and I look
forwarding to talking to them on IRC (I have put quite a few names to faces
on the #lopsa channel on freenode).</p>

<h3>My Highlight Reel</h3>

<p><strong>My favorite training session:</strong><br>
<em>NOTE:</em> I only took 2 half day sessions<br>
Ganeti: Your private virtualization cloud - Tom Lemoncelli &amp; Guido Trotter</p>

<p><strong>My favorite bof:</strong><br>
I&#8217;ve made a huge mistake (organizer unknown)<br></p>

<p>This deserves a bit of a write up. My favorite bof was a user bof entitled
&#8216;I&#8217;ve made a huge mistake&#8217;. It was very last minute. It was was kind of
like an alcoholics anonymous for sysadmins. People shared their screw ups,
and what they did to fix them. It was pretty awesome (I don&#8217;t think I can
repeat any of those stories), including and especially my own :) )</p>

<p><strong>My favorite technical session:</strong><br>
15 years of DevOps<br>
I was really floored in seeing the 15 year old slides talking about the
same problems and issues that we are having now. Here is a pic of the
devops talk:</p>

<p><img src="/images/confroom.jpg" title="DevOps panaramic" ></p>

<p><strong>My favorite quote from the conference:</strong><br>
(from the disruptive technology panel)<br>
&#8220;Software is going to stick with us like Herpes.&#8221; - Theo Schlossnagle, OmniTI</p>

<p><strong>The reception (Shaken, Not Stirred)</strong><br></p>

<p>After Thursday&#8217;s events were finished at 5:00 most people dropped off their
gear and grabbed a coat (it was raining and slightly chilly) and several buses
took us to the &#8216;Grape Street Peer&#8217;. We went aboard a large boat:</p>

<p><img src="http://gallery.photo.net/photo/12999613-md.jpg" title="I'm on a boat!" ></p>

<p>and had a nice meal with an open bar, and got to play blackjack, roulette, and
craps with some fake money that was handed out. It was pretty funny, because I
would say 50+ percent of attendees knew how to count cards. The staff handed
out extra fake money to whoever lost quickly so it didn&#8217;t really matter. As a
bonus we got to keep some of the custom LISA&#8217;12 casino chips at the end of the
night.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>I quite enjoyed the experience, and look forward to attending another LISA. I
will hopefully be going to the Washington DC one, but if not I will for sure be
at the 2014 one in Seattle.</p>

<p>All in all, I had a great time.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2012-10-16T22:26:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 16<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>what is dset?</p>

<p>DSET is &#8220;Dell System E-Support Tool&#8221;, it is available for windows, 32bit linux and 64 bit linux. Essentially dell uses this tool to gather information about your server to help them troubleshoot. I&#8217;m only writing about the 64 bit linux version.</p>

<p>why do you care?</p>

<p>If you call dell tech support sooner or later (sooner I&#8217;m betting) they are going to ask for a dset. I wanted to dig into, what they are gathering and share with my fellow sysadmins.</p>

<h4>The story</h4>

<p>I had a raid controller battery go bad after 2 years, still under warranty, but dell wanted a dset. Never mind I had a dmidecode for the firmware versions and some megacli64 output to show the battery reports, they wanted a dset.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how my conversation went:</p>

<p>dell: There is a firmware bug that falsely reports a bad battery when your battery is still good, we are going to need a dset.<br/>
me: does dset need root?<br/>
dell: yes.<br/>
me: what does it need root for, as in, what exactly is it running?<br/>
dell: I don&#8217;t know. <br/>
me: okay I&#8217;ll download it, check it out, and call you back.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in the medical industry, so installing new/unvetted software on production servers is usually a no-no, and it makes me nervous. So I wasn&#8217;t about to install it without some testing and analysis (on a blank virtual machine).</p>

<p>In fairness to dell, I could have said &#8220;I&#8217;m a gold customer with a 4 hour turnaround, ship me the new battery now please&#8221; and they would have. but I like to be co-operative with my fellow techies if I can.</p>

<h1>The analysis</h1>

<p>I&#8217;m not one to trust binaries that need to be run as root very much, so let&#8217;s take a look at what we are getting ourselves into.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/en/dell_system_tool">dell&#8217;s dset page</a></p>

<p>at time of writing the latest version is 3.2.0.141_x64_A01.bin</p>

<p>Due to running this on a virtual machine it didn&#8217;t want to install from running the script, so I extracted it manually via:</p>

<pre><code>tail -n+20 dell-dset-3.2.0.141_x64_A01.bin | tar -xvz
</code></pre>

<p>The tarball doesn&#8217;t make it&#8217;s own directory it litters a bit in your current directory (shame shame).</p>

<h2>install.sh</h2>

<p>The install.sh does a bunch of pre-checks to see if you have supported hardware before collecting it&#8217;s data. It&#8217;s fairly simple to disable the check and run it anyway or add your system to the &#8216;support_hw_list&#8217; or just copy some exports from the install script and run (more on this later).</p>

<p>Once it decides it will install it will install one/some/all of the following depending on what options you choose:</p>

<pre><code>rpm -Uhv rpms/srvadmin-hapi* &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
rpm -Uhv rpms/srvadmin-storelib-sysfs*.rpm &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
rpm -Uhv rpms/dell-dset-common* --nodeps &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
rpm -Uhv rpms/dell-dset-collector* --nodeps &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
rpm -Uhv rpms/dell-dset-provider* --nodeps &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>

<p>rhel only:</p>

<pre><code>rpm -ihv rpms/RHEL/sblim-sfcb*.rpm --nodeps &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
rpm -Uhv rpms/RHEL/sblim-cmpi-base*.rpm --nodeps &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>

<p>sles only:</p>

<pre><code>rpm -Uhv rpms/SLES/cim-schema*.rpm &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
rpm -ihv rpms/SLES/sblim-sfcb*.rpm --nodeps &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
rpm -Uhv rpms/SLES/sblim-indication_helper*.rpm &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
rpm -Uhv rpms/SLES/sblim-cmpi-base*.rpm --nodeps &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, I&#8217;m not a fan of the &#8211;nodeps, but if they are staying in their own sandbox I can forgive them. So let&#8217;s find out. On the first set of rpms:</p>

<pre><code>$ rpm -qlp *.rpm |grep -v "^/opt"
/etc/init.d/dsm_sa_ipmi
/etc/init.d/instsvcdrv
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/srvadmin-hapi-x86_64.conf
/etc/sysconfig/dsm_sa_ipmi
/usr/lib64/libdchapi.so.5
/usr/lib64/libdchapi64.so
/usr/lib64/libdchbas.so.5
/usr/lib64/libdchbas64.so
/usr/lib64/libdchcfl.so.5
/usr/lib64/libdchcfl64.so
/usr/lib64/libdchesm.so.5
/usr/lib64/libdchesm64.so
/usr/lib64/libdchipm.so.5
/usr/lib64/libdchipm64.so
/usr/lib64/libdchtvm.so.5
/usr/lib64/libdchtvm64.so
</code></pre>

<p>Alright, not going to install this in the production environment already, but lets throw caution to the wind on this vm.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m running centos, so depending on what options I select, the dset installer may install sblim (sublime), with nodeps of course. This could be problematic if you are also using the epel sublime package.</p>

<p>At least they are no longer using rpm &#8211;force &#8211;nodeps like they were in previous versions of dset (which they still get you to use if you are using rhel 5.x)).</p>

<p>The install.sh parses out what you want to do and runs the &#8216;collector&#8217; program with the various options (more on this later).</p>

<h2>Manual Install</h2>

<p>Going to play with the dell-dset*.rpm&#8217;s first.</p>

<p>For fun I looked at a rpm -ivh dell-dset*.rpm to see what dependencies I was about to ignore. What&#8217;s weird is they are packaging all of their dependencies, so I&#8217;m not sure why they don&#8217;t just update the spec to do a provides: bla and fix it. Maybe they are trying not to mess with the rpm database, but if that was the case, why are we using rpms at all? Running rpm &#8211;nodeps is almost the same as doing a tarball. How much stuff are they doing in their rpm&#8217;s %pre and %post that they can&#8217;t do in their install script? I digress.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get this installed.</p>

<pre><code>rpm --nodeps -ivh dell-dset*.rpm
</code></pre>

<p>This will install to /opt/dell/advdiags/dset</p>

<h2>The Collector</h2>

<pre><code>cd /opt/dell/advdiags/dset/bin
./collector --help
  File "/usr/lib/python3.1/site-packages/cx_Freeze/initscripts/Console3.py", line 27, in &lt;module&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we know it&#8217;s a python 3.1 script. :)</p>

<pre><code>$ file collector
collector: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.4, stripped
</code></pre>

<p>But not something we can easily look at without getting a python decompiler or strace involved.</p>

<p>Our paths won&#8217;t be correct but dell gave us a collector.sh which will setup the correct paths for you (and restore your old path when you are done) that&#8217;s nice.</p>

<pre><code>./collector.sh --help
</code></pre>

<p>there we go. a nice help file so we can figure out what we want to do. Being that I&#8217;m on a vm, the hardware option isn&#8217;t going to do much for me. So I&#8217;ll start with the software.</p>

<pre><code>./collector.sh -d sw
</code></pre>

<p>It asks right away for my root password (I&#8217;m already running it as root). If I reached this stage in production I would abort, but I&#8217;m on a vm, so I&#8217;ll break out and change root to &#8216;1234&#8217; and run it again. But not to worry, the dset documentation states:</p>

<pre><code>NOTE: Root credentials are necessary for the DSET
        Provider to collect inventory or
        configuration information about the system.
        DSET does not store this password. The root
        password must be specified each time a report
        is collected.
</code></pre>

<p>We&#8217;ll find out if this is true or not shortly.</p>

<pre><code>./collector.sh -d sw -p 1234
</code></pre>

<p>huzzah! I have a report.</p>

<pre><code>./collector.sh -d sw -p 1234 -v yes
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have a report with privacy enabled to compare.</p>

<h2>The Report</h2>

<p>The report gets thrown into a passworded zip file. The password is completely meaningless as, if you unzip it with no password, it unzips a text file which tells you the password is &#8216;dell&#8217;. So I unzip&#8217;ed again this time with the super secret password. The password is the same in privacy mode or non privacy mode.</p>

<h3>The non privacy report</h3>

<p>The non privacy report gathers it&#8217;s data from many cfg files and logs. It also parses the data into xml/xsl pages which I assume dell has a nice tool to go through quickly to see what&#8217;s what.</p>

<p>From looking at the logs directory the collector is gathering the following:</p>

<pre><code>cat boot/grub/menu.lst
cat boot/grub/device.map
ls /boot
uptime
cat /proc/meminfo
lsmod
cat /etc/modprobe.conf
cat lib/modules/current/modules.dep
ifconfig
cat /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/hosts
cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*
df
cat /proc/scsi/scsi
fdisk -l
free
hostname
list of all installed rpms / versions / etc
iptables dump
ldconfig
lspci
mount
osversion
print's environment settings
ps
pstree
route (old school route not ip route ls, shame shame)
selinux policies
runs thru the init.d and does a service status on each
sestatus
uname
</code></pre>

<p>See that ps up there?</p>

<pre><code>grep "collector" ps
root     20589 13.0  1.5 133620 15408 pts/1    S+   23:17   0:00 ./collector -d sw -p 1234
</code></pre>

<p>So much for not saving my root password. It also shows up in:</p>

<pre><code>rawxml/getprocesslist.xml
xml/processlist.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Before anyone gets mad at dell: I&#8217;m running this in a non standard way, if I used the install.sh the script would not use the -p option, and would instead prompt me for a password (which would not show up in the processlist). Still not sure why it wants me to type the root password when I am already running it as root, but ok.</p>

<p>Next the collector has straight up copied my:</p>

<pre><code>boot/grub/grub.conf
boot/grub/menu.lst
etc/aliases
etc/cron* (crontab, crondirs, etc)
etc/fstab
etc/host*
etc/ld.so.conf
etc/modprobe.conf
etc/redhat-release
etc/resolv.conf
etc/sysctl.conf
etc/mail/sendmail.cf
etc/pam.d/* (WAT?)
etc/sysconfig/* (entire dir and subdirs)
etc/X11/XF86Config
lib/modules/current/modules.dep
proc/ (many files copied here, 778)
var/log/dmesg
var/log/messages
</code></pre>

<p>This is WAY to much information to send to dell for any reason. How are you sending it to dell as well? I sure wouldn&#8217;t email it.</p>

<h3>The privacy report</h3>

<p>In the privacy report you get a lot less data. The logs directory is now blank, so everything is in the gui directory only. Which means we get to go through some annoying xml/xls (note: I find all xml/xsl annoying (don&#8217;t ask)). Allot of the same data is gathered, but now just dumped into xml.</p>

<p>We are gathering:</p>

<pre><code>/boot/grub/grub.conf
ls /boot
ls /boot/grub
cat boot/grub/device.map
chassis info
etc/X11/XF86Config
lsmod
cat /etc/modprobe.conf
cat lib/modules/current/modules.dep
list all rpms / publisher / size / install date, urlinfo, description
hardware io ranges
hardware irq info
cat /proc/meminfo
cat /etc/fstab
ifconfig (with ip info and mac addresses "Omitted by user")
cat resolv.conf (everything is omitted by user but domain is still listed. WAT?)
runs thru the init.d and does a service status on each
storage info (df info)
os version and kernel
connected usb devices
</code></pre>

<p>I like how the kernel version is omitted in the uname but is in the syssumlist. Heh.</p>

<h3>Other options</h3>

<p>The collector script has many different options, I don&#8217;t have any non-production dell gear right now, so I&#8217;m not willing to run the hardware report on a server that has hardware to run it on.</p>

<p>I ran the -lg and -ad options in the collector as well, but there was no difference to the sw logs. I imagine this would be different if I was running on an actual dell machine with actual dell hardware instead of the virtual machine that I&#8217;m running this on. :)</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I won&#8217;t be running the dset tool on any production gear because:</p>

<ul>
<li>The package installation could cause issues with your system (not staying in /opt/dell, using &#8211;nodeps, conflicting sblim package with epel&#8217;s)</li>
<li>It wants your root password to be entered at a prompt of a python program, even if you are currently root</li>
<li>the non privacy report gathers way to much info about your system, under no circumstances should this be sent to anyone ever.</li>
<li>the password on the report zip is incredible insecure</li>
<li>add the domain in the resolv.conf to private information, or just don&#8217;t parse the resolv.conf at all</li>
</ul>


<h1>So what happened?</h1>

<p>I told the dell tech that I couldn&#8217;t run the dset tool due to dset doing some bad behaviors; but I had a dmidecode, and some megacli logs to send.</p>

<p>After dell reviewed the logs I emailed they shipped me a new battery.</p>

<h1>tldr version</h1>

<p>don&#8217;t run dset. If you absolutely must use dset, use the privacy option.</p>
